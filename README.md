# Cubes-and-Balls

This is supposed to be a simple 3D-game futuring:
 - 3D rendering
 - Physics
 - Simple light sources/lighting
 - First person camera controls

---
Once that all works, future TODO goals might include:
 - User Interface overlay
 - Actual gameplay

---
There is a developer readme in the Cubes And Balls folder.
This is a top-level folder containing anything that isn't a project resource.

This is my first project I've built completely from scratch in C++, and mostly me 
practicing how to setup a project leaning heavily on OOP.
